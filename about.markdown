## Bus Factor Critical

[Bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) is this basic idea that
falls from a lack of shared knowledge, responsiblity, and/or ownership in a
thing.  "What happens when Sally gets hit by a bus?" (sorry Sally).  If that
_were_ to happen, what the impact on the people relative to the thing.

### Within Source Code Repository, Lies the (meta)Information

LowEndInsight was born in the basement of a windowless building somewhere
not-so-interesting.  It was then nurtered by a handful of researchers at
[Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://gtri.gatech.edu) as a software engineering/research tool,
taking advantage of available HPC resources - and released as [OSS itself](https://github.com/gtri/lowendinsight).

At the core of this learning and research was applied distribution technique,
specifically using [Erlang](https://erlang.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)'s incredible footing in this space.

LowEndInsight has produced papers and talks, including details about the
complexities associated with navigating from a language's package ecosystem
back to the source code.  While LowEndInsight was not the first tool to poke at
the "bus factor" problem associated with open-source software - it was the
first to address the notion of "functional contributions and contributors" and
the myths around the scope of communities relevance on the quality of the
actual source code.

Since then, LowEndInsight is growing into a publicly avaiable API, for anyone
to query a known-good, and valid Git repository.  And the depth (get it low-end)
of information gleened from repositories is expanding.
