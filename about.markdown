LowEndInsight was born in the basement of a windowless building somewhere
not-so-interesting.  It was then nurtered by a handful of researchers at
Georgia Tech Research Institute as a software engineering/research tool,
taking advantage of available HPC resources.

At the core of this learning and research was applied distribution technique,
specifically using Erlang and Elixir's incredible footing in this space.

LowEndInsight has produced papers and talks, including details about the
complexities associated with navigating from a language's package ecosystem
back to the source code.  While LowEndInsight was the first tool to poke at
the "bus factor" problem associated with open-source software - it was the
first to address the notion of "functional contributions and contributors" and
the myths around the scope of communities relevance on the quality of the
actual source code.

Since then, LowEndInsight is growing into a publicly avaiable API, for anyone
to query a known-good, and valid Git repository.  And the depth (get it low-end)
of information gleened from repositories is expanding.
